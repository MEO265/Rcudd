\title{Reduce literals of boolean expression}
\usage{
bdd_literals(expr)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{A character vector of length 1 containing a boolean expression in C++ syntax.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements:
* `constant`: logical scalar. `TRUE` or `FALSE` when the expression reduces to
  a constant, otherwise `NA`.
* `variables`: character vector with the remaining literal names (empty when
  `constant` is set).
* `initial_variables`: all literal names that appeared in the original
  expression.
}
\description{
Builds a reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD) via CUDD from the
provided expression and reports which literals remain in the diagram after
reduction.
}
\details{
Allowed operators are `!` (negation), `&` (and), `|` (or) and `^` (XOR).
Parentheses can be used for grouping. Variable names are any non-empty
strings that are neither operators nor whitespace, which makes the parser
reusable from other functions.
}
\examples{
bdd_literals("x & !x")
bdd_literals("(y & x) | (y & !x)")
