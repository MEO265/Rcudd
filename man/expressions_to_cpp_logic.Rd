\title{Convert multiple R expressions to C++ style logical strings with shared placeholders}
\usage{
expressions_to_cpp_logic(..., use_placeholders = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more quoted R expressions or character scalars that can be
parsed with [str2lang()].}

\item{use_placeholders}{Logical flag indicating whether non-operator
sub-expressions should be replaced by placeholders. When `FALSE`, the
original `deparse()`d expression is kept in the output string while the
placeholder mapping is still reported.}
}
\value{
A list with elements
* `expressions`: character vector with the C++ style logic strings for each
  input expression, in order.
* `placeholders`: named character vector that maps placeholder names to the
  original expression strings, shared across all inputs.
* `order_variables`: named character vector that maps variable tokens (`n1`,
  `n2`, …) to the variable names used in comparisons.
}
\description{
Processes several quoted expressions at once so that common subexpressions
are assigned the same placeholder across all inputs. This makes it easier to
apply consistent substitutions when the resulting expressions are evaluated
elsewhere (for example in C++ code).
