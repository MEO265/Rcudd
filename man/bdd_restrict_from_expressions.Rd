\title{Build a BDD restriction chain from R expressions with ordering constraints}
\usage{
bdd_restrict_from_expressions(exprs)
}
\arguments{
\item{exprs}{List of quoted R expressions or character scalars that can be
parsed with [str2lang()].}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
* `expressions`: logical expressions translated to C++ syntax.
* `placeholders`: mapping of placeholder names to original expression strings.
* `order_variables`: mapping of comparison variable tokens to their names.
* `chain`: result of [bdd_restrict_chain()] with ordering constraints applied.
}
\description{
Converts one or more R expressions to C++ style logical strings using
[cpp_logic_from_expressions()] and evaluates them with [bdd_restrict_chain()],
automatically supplying ordering constraints derived from placeholders for
comparison operators.
}
\examples{
bdd_restrict_from_expressions(list(quote(x || y < z || y >= z)))
