\title{Generate ordering constraints for comparison placeholders}
\usage{
order_constraints(tokens)
}
\arguments{
\item{tokens}{Character vector of placeholder tokens such as `"n1"`,
`"n2"`, ... representing the variables that are compared.}
}
\value{
Character vector with boolean expressions in C++ syntax (operators
  `!`, `&`, `|`). The expressions can be passed to downstream routines as
  additional constraints.
}
\description{
Constructs logical constraints for placeholders of the form `L_n1_n2`,
`E_n1_n2` and `G_n1_n2` that encode the outcome of pairwise comparisons.
The constraints ensure that exactly one relation holds for each unordered
pair of tokens, add transitivity rules and enforce reflexive equality
(`E_x_x`).
}
\examples{
order_constraints(c("n1", "n2", "n3"))
